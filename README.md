# anti-spam-bot
This bot will monitor the server for spam, flood and other unwanted messages and automatically delete them


This bot will respond to all messages on the server that are not commands (starting with the prefix !), and delete those 
messages that are longer than 10 characters (this can be changed as needed). In addition, it will send messages warning 
users to delete their messages due to suspected spam or flooding.

Note: Before running the bot, you need to insert your bot's token in the last line of code bot.run('TOKEN'). The token 
can be obtained in the "Bot" section of your Discord developer page. You also need to add your bot to the server you want to run it on.
