**Step 1: Creating a new Discord bot and obtaining the bot token.**
1. Go to the Discord Developer website (https://discord.com/developers/applications).
2. Log in to your existing account or create a new one.
3. Click on "New Application" and enter the name of your bot.
4. Navigate to the "Bot" tab on the left-hand menu.
5. Click on "Add Bot" and confirm the creation of the bot.
6. In the "Token" section, click "Copy" to save your bot's token. Remember to keep this token secure and do not share it publicly or with anyone else.

**Step 2: Inviting the bot to your Discord server.**
1. Go back to the "General Information" tab of your application.
2. Find your Client ID and copy it.
3. Log in to your Discord server and go to the "OAuth2" tab in the server settings.
4. In the "OAuth2 URL Generator" section, select the "bot" option.
5. Under "Scopes," choose "bot."
6. Under "Bot Permissions," select the necessary permissions for your bot (e.g., "Read Messages," "Send Messages," "Manage Messages," etc., depending on the Anti-Spam features you plan to use).
7. Copy the generated OAuth2 URL and open it in a web browser.
8. Choose the server where you want to invite your bot and click "Authorize."

**Step 3: Writing the code for the Anti-Spam bot.**
To implement the Anti-Spam bot, you will need a library that provides a convenient interface for working with the Discord API. For example, you can use the discord.py library for Python.

Here's an example code for a basic Anti-Spam bot using discord.py:

```python
import discord
from discord.ext import commands

intents = discord.Intents.default()
intents.message_content = True

bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix='!', intents=intents)

# Create a dictionary to store message counters for each user
spam_counter = {}

@bot.event
async def on_ready():
    print(f'Logged in as {bot.user.name}')

@bot.event
async def on_message(message):
    if message.author.bot:
        return  # Ignore messages from bots

    # Check if the author of the message is in the dictionary and increment the counter by 1
    if message.author.id in spam_counter:
        spam_counter[message.author.id] += 1
    else:
        spam_counter[message.author.id] = 1

    # If a user sends more than 5 messages in a row, delete them
    if spam_counter[message.author.id] > 5:
        await message.delete()
        await message.channel.send(f'{message.author.mention}, stop spamming!')

    await bot.process_commands(message)

@bot.command(name='clear_spam')
async def clear_spam_counter(ctx):
    # Command to clear the spam counters
    spam_counter.clear()
    await ctx.send('Spam counters have been cleared.')

bot.run('YOUR_BOT_TOKEN')
```

**Step 4: Running the Anti-Spam bot.**
Run your bot by executing the code file from the command line or by hosting it on a hosting server. Once the bot is running, it will begin monitoring messages and reacting to spam.

**Please note that this example is basic and does not include additional Anti-Spam features such as checking for spam messages with identical text or using machine learning algorithms to detect spam. You can extend this code based on your needs and the requirements of your Discord server.**
